        <h1> <a name="fundamental">Windows Fundamental </a> </h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows applications can be developed using a procedure -oriented approach oin either C or C++.</li>
            <li>All approaches bring together point and shoot control, pop-up menus, and the ability to run applications
                written especially for the Windows Environment. </li>
            <li> Windows gives the ability to develop Graphics User Interface(GUI).</li>
        </ul>
        <h1><a name="environment"> The Windows Environment</a></h1>
        <ul>
            <li>Windows is a graphics-based multitasking operating system.</li>
            <li>Programs developed for this environment have a consistent look and command structure.</li>
            <li>To the user, this makes learning each successive Windows application easier.</li>
            <li>To help in the development of Windows application. Windows provides numerous <b>built-in</b> functions
                that allow for easy implementation of pop-up menus, scroll bars, dialog boxes, icons that represent a
                user-friendly interface.</li>
            <li>Windows permits the application to work in a hardware-independent manner.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>Basically there are two fundamental different kinds of C++ applications, we can develop with visual C++:
                <ol>
                    <li> Application that natively execute on our computer. These applications are referred to as native
                        C++ programs. We write native C++ program in the version of C++ that is defined
                        by ISO/ANSI language standard.</li>
                    <li>We can also write applications to run under the control of the CLR in an extended
                        version of C++, called C++/CLI. These Programs are referred to as CLR program or
                        C++/CLI Program.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>The .Net framework is not strictly part of visual C++, but rather a component of the
                windows operating system that makes it easier to build Software(s/w) application.</li>
            <li>Advantage of .Net Framework:
                Code Reliability(Fault Tolerance), Security, and Ability to integrate C++ code with other
                languages that targets the .Net framework.</li>
        </ul>
        <h1> <a name="definition">Some Definitions</a></h1>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>Common Language Runtime(CLR): </h4>
            </li>The CLR is a standardized-environment for execution of program written in a wide-range of
            high-level languages including visual C++.
            <h5>Important :</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>The specification of the CLR is standardized by European Computer
                    Manufacturer (ECMA) standard for the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), and CLR is an
                    implementation of that standard for Microsoft Windows.</li>
                <li>
                    That is why C++ for CLR is referred to as C++/CLI, as it is the implementation of
                    specification of CLI by CLR.
                </li>
            </ol>

            <li>
                <h4>Common Language Infrastructure(CLI): </h4>
            </li>
            The CLI is a specification for a Virtual Machine environment that enables applications
            written in diverse high-level programming language to be executed in different system
            environment, without changing or recompiling the original source code.
            <ol>
                <li>The CLI specifies a standard intermediate language for the virtual machine to which the
                    high-level language code is compiled. With .Net framework, this intermediate language is
                    called Microsoft Intermediate Language(MSIL). The code in the intermediate language is
                    ultimately mapped to machine code by a Just-In-Time(JIT) compiler, when we execute the
                    program.</li>
                <li>Code in the CLI intermediate language can be executed within any other environment
                    that has a CLI implementation.</li>
                <li>The CLI also defines a common set of data types called the Common Type System(CTS), that
                    should be used for program written in any programming language targeting a CLI
                    implementation.</li>
                <li>The CTS specifies how data types are used within the CLR and includes a set of
                    predefined types. We can Create our own datatypes, but that must be consistent with
                    CTS.</li>

                <h4>Console Application:</h4> Command line character-based program. Two ways of writing console
                application:
                <ul>
                    <li>Win32 Console applications, compile to native code. (way we have seen so far).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>Using Windows Operating System API.</li>
                    <li>This will enable us to understand how a windows application works behind the scene.This is the
                        fundamental interface that the windows operating system provides for
                        communications between itself and the applications that are executing under its
                        control.</li>
                    <li>Using Microsoft Foundation Class (MFC): Set of classes that encapsulates the Windows
                        operating system API for GUI creation and program development.</li>
