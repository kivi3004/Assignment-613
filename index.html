                    <p>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language, which is the most widely used language on Web to
                        develop web pages.
                        HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML 2.0" was the first standard HTML
                        specification which was published in 1995.
                        HTML 4.01 was a major version of HTML and it was published in late 1999.
                        Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently we are having HTML-5 version which is an
                        extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012.<a href="htmldoc.html">see

                    <p>JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform and interpreted scripting language. It is well-known
                        for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be
                        used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a
                        standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements
                        like operators, control structures, and statements.<a href="jsdoc.html"> see more... </a></p>

                    <p>Building Window-based applications was a complicated endeavor in the past; this is no longer the
                        case. Included n the .NET Framework Class Library is an entire subsystem of classes that enables
                        you to create highly interactive, attractive, graphical user interface (GUI) applications.
