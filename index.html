                widely used language on Web to develop web pages. HTML was created by Berners-Lee in late 1991 but "HTML
                2.0" was the first standard HTML specification which was published in 1995. HTML 4.01 was a major
                version of HTML and it was published in late 1999. Though HTML 4.01 version is widely used but currently
                we are having HTML-5 version which is an extension to HTML 4.01, and this version was published in 2012

                describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is designed to
                enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.[3] This
                separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification
                of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the
                relevant CSS in a separate .css file which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content
                as well as enabling the .css file to be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that
                share the file and its formatting...<span><a href="./HTML/cssdoc.html">more</a></span></td>

                Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. JavaScript contains a standard library of
                objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control
